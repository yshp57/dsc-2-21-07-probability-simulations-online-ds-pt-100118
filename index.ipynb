We saw that we get almost the same results through random sampling as we do from solving mathematical equations. consider the difference in computation while running these simulations and calculating a simple formula. For much complex problems with larger datasets, having an understanding the underlying probabilities can help you solve a lot of optimization problems as we shall see ahead. "
